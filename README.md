### Key Infrastructure Features:
1. Separate VPC with public and private subnets
2. ECR repositories for frontend and backend
3. ECS Fargate services for both frontend and backend
4. Application Load Balancers for each service
5. Auto-scaling configurations
6. Security groups with controlled ingress/egress
7. VPC Endpoint for secure private communication

### Network Design:
- Frontend and backend in separate private subnets
- Public subnets for load balancers
- NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access
- VPC Endpoint for secure internal communication

### Secure Communication:
- Inter-service communication through VPC Endpoint
- No public internet exposure for backend service
- Controlled security group rules

### Additional Notes:
- Customize variables in `variables.tf`
- Adjust subnet CIDRs and configurations as needed
- Add more specific security rules as per your requirements

### Deployment Steps:
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Adjust variables in `variables.tf`
3. Run `terraform init`
4. Run `terraform plan`
5. Run `terraform apply`
